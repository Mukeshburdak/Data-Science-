🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using PCA & Logistic Regressio
-
📌 Project Overview
-
This project explores dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and evaluates its impact on breast cancer classification.
The goal is to visualize high-dimensional data, reduce complexity, and compare model performance using 2 vs 3 PCA components.

🔬 Results Summary
-
PCA Components	Performance Insight
2 Components	Good visualization, slightly lower recall
3 Components	Better class separation and higher ROC–AUC

Observation:
PCA with 3 components captures more variance, leading to improved classification performance, especially in detecting malignant cases.
